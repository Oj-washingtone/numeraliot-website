        feature: "Speed Limiting",
        explanation:
          "Commercial vehicles, matatus, omnibuses, and other public service vehicles are restricted from exceeding 80 kilometers per hour on Kenyan roads. Simba 5G enforces this by capping the speed at 80 km/h. If the vehicle exceeds this limit, an alarm goes off, and if the driver does not slow down, the engine will progressively reduce the vehicle's speed to 80 km/h",

        feature: "Integrated GPS Tracking ",
        explanation:
          "Simba Speed Governor's GPS tracking system uses satellite technology to pinpoint vehicles in real time.
